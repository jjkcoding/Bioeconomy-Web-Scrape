We use advanced design and analysis techniques, derived from our expertise in the Aerospace sector, to provide our customers with smart, innovative solutions. We follow new projects from the preliminary design phase to experimental tests, suggesting a mixed approach able to minimise development time and costs.","The advantages of our propulsion system, compared to competitive solutions, are even more numerous:
1. decrease in hull resistance, due to ingestion of the boundary layer, resulting in lower fuel consumption
2. increased thrust efficiency at low speeds: instead of running only one engine at part load (which is highly inefficient), some engines will run at optimal conditions, others will be switched off
3. increased manoeuvrability, as the speed and thrust of each engine can be controlled
4. decrease in propeller draft, particularly important in shallow waters
5. ease of installation on hydrofoils
6. greater safety for man and fish (closed propeller) and less water turbulence for less impact on the marine environment.
There are also some cons: increased complexity of controls and potential increase in production costs: however, we believe we can keep production costs low due to the reduced number of batteries, increased modularity and elimination of gearboxes.","The electric boat market was valued at $4.58 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $9.01 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 12.65% during the forecast period (2021 - 2026). At Nablawave, we want to target the electric propulsion market, estimated at 1-1.5 billion. The interesting fact about this market is the high growth expected in the coming years, which will be driven not only by increasing demand, but also by new emission laws and regulations.
Our technology solution is perfectly suited to the growing market for electric boats: its adoption will increase the efficiency with which power is managed and distributed in a boat compared to current electric configurations, freeing up even more market potential; moreover, its implementation is only possible with hybrid or full-electric propulsion configurations, which would not be feasible with older diesel engines. We expect that not all boats and boat sizes will benefit equally from our solution; therefore, a first step in the business development process will be to identify the boats and boat sizes that will benefit most from our propulsion system. The following steps are envisaged:
1. determination of the positive benefits for different boat classes
2. development and testing of the prototype on the smallest possible scale (power boats, pleasure boats)
3. development of partnerships with shipyards on pilot projects at different scales
4. evaluation of partnerships with companies interested in the industrial production of propulsion system components; during this time Nablawave will make the decision to license its patent to a production partner (retaining IP royalties and R&amp;D activities) or to establish a spin-off company focused on the development and commercialisation of the propulsion system
5. pre-sales of retrofit systems for small boats
6. serial industrialisation of small propulsion system modules
7. development of larger modules for larger vessels","Yes, we have a patent pending.",Our technology is still under development.,"Ships are estimated to cause up to 40% of air pollution in Mediterranean coastal cities. A report by the French Ministry of the Environment states that ship pollution causes around 6000 premature deaths in the Mediterranean each year. Our project is related to the development of an innovative, emission-free electric propulsion system for boats and ships. Nowadays, the use of electric motors in the marine sector is seen as a problem because of the enormous amount of energy storage required to achieve a reasonable range for the boat: large volumes of batteries, fuel cells or a combination of the two are needed to compete with traditional diesel-powered boats. Our patented technology will decrease the energy storage required for electric boats, helping to increase the adoption of more sustainable and green electric propulsion. This will have a positive impact on coastal areas in particular, as it will accelerate the transition to electric boats. In particular, if our technology is successful in the market, ports and port cities like Taranto will experience a reduction in air pollution.
If production is carried out in partnership with large companies in Puglia, the reconversion of old production facilities could be an opportunity for new jobs in the area.

We aim to establish a competitive supply chain in Europe that recovers vegetable oils from underused industrial residues and transforms them into marketable commodities. We use green chemistry and biotechnological processes, free of fossil-based solvents, to extract oils from bio-waste, and market them in the cosmetics and (potentially food) industry.
We are cooperating with an instant coffee factory in Germany, and research partners at Helmholtz and Fraunhofer centers to secure fast technology development, and a reliable supply chain and scalability. Our oils meet the quality demands as well as the standards of sustainable ingredients and our business is embedded in a circular economy so far overlooked in the field.","RECOV Labs developed a technology that uses infrastructure already available at the industrial level. Our products are produced in a non-seasonal way, with a quality that matches conventional oils, and with technologies that are afordable and do not harm the environment. Due to the abundance of waste biomass, upcycled coffee oil does not require additional land use, does not conflict with food/feed production, and has the potential to significantly reduce imports of palm oil. We will become a supplier of sustainable vegetable oils for cosmetics developers committed to sustainable practices in Germany and potentially France, which have the largest consumer markets for cosmetics in Europe (13.6 and 12 € Billion), foreseeing a major mindset-changing impact on the market. Moreover, we are contributing to a Sustainable Bioconomy by recycling bio-waste and mitigating GHS emissions caused by landfilling of unused coffee grounds.","Our business model focuses on the procurement of bio-waste from instant coffee factories in Germany, its distribution to storage and extraction centers, the further development of efficient extraction technologies, and the distribution of upcycled oils to cosmetics and food market manufacturers (B2B model).
Our main product is coffee oil obtained from a German instant coffee factory. Upcycled coffee oil has similar properties and fatty-acid composition to palm oil, being a perfect candidate to cover its increasing demand in the cosmetics and food sector. Upcycle coffee oil has also been approved as a cosmetic ingredient, its skin benefits have been demonstrated and it is already in use by a few sustainable brands in Europe. We tested different extraction technologies to render a method that provides higher oil yields, and better organoleptic properties, in comparison to our main competitor.","Currently, we do not have any patents registered. The first patent is planned to be filed by the end of 2023.","Yes, a few companies focused on the extraction of essential oils and cosmetics ingredients are using supercritical CO2 as a solvent for the extraction of high-quality substances.","The vegetable oil industry is at the heart of food and non-food supply chains. European mills process and extract oil from rapeseed, sunflower seed, and soybeans; however, to fulfill the demand for vegetable oils, the industry relies on imported tropical oils such as palm, palm kernel, and coconut oil. Emerging regulations and concerns on the tropical oils supply chain and its linkage to deforestation have grown the need for long-term sustainable and responsible solutions for meeting consumer needs and societal expectations. In addition, the vegetable oils supply chain has shown to be highly sensitive to crises such as the Covid19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, revealing extreme price volatility and scarcity.  Moreover, almost all commercial vegetable oils are extracted using hexane, refined from petroleum.
Commodities manufacturers are now more than ever committed to ensuring that alternative vegetable oils meet strict sustainability standards and give, whenever possible, priority to domestically produced oils. Coffee has an oil content of 20% in dry mass, which has been untouched during the fermentation, roasting, and caffeine extraction from the coffee grounds, making spent coffee grounds (Kaffesatz in German), a bio-waste from food processing in the EU, an ideal bio-waste for the recovery of oils to replace exported tropical oils.",RECOV LABS,1-Sep-23,2 - Manufacturing concepts identified,101.000 to 250.000,"English, German, Español",,TRL 5 – technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies),"Berlín, Alemania","Biotech, Fragrances, Cosmetics, Personal Care, Waste valorisation",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research at Biowerkz has resulted in development of a new class of bio-based, resource-efficient, and CO2-negative material called “NEWood” which is developed using only available organic waste including wood waste and agricultural waste and produced using mushroom mycelium as a natural binder without the need for any synthetic binders. NEWood is a 100% biobased replacement for wood and engineered wood products and is produced following a circular economy model where no freshly cut wood or freshly cut natural fiber is used. Furthermore, NEWood aims to create a paradigm shift within construction sector by upcycling, transforming, and repurposing million tonnes of organic waste in to “wood from no wood” to address greenhouse gas emissions by the construction and furniture industry. The research has shown that NEWood has comparable properties to engineered wood products such as Medium Density Fiber boards (MDF), Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and particleboards. The use of mycelium, the structural part of fungi which forms its vegetative growth and mass is a novel binding method to facilitate the production of a 100% sustainable, biobased, and fully circular engineered wood product alternative.","Sustainability is at the core of our work. We aim to commercialize NEWood as new class of sustainable, biobased materials that is engineered to complement the role of wood-based products in construction and furniture industry by replacing energy-intensive and non-renewable components currently being used. Through the research and development works on NEWood, the founding team of Biowerkz with more than 10 years of work experiences, address at least five of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) namely Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, and Goal 15.
Most importantly the global forests are under threat from deforestation and degradation due to excessive demand for wood-based products, secondly the CO2 emission from production of synthetic resins and binders for production of wood-based products have led to major negative impacts on climate change, and thirdly majority of the available wood-based products do not conform to circular economy principles; thus, actions need to be taken to reduce the pressure from our forest and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our industries. With these respects “NEWood” has been developed to answer the call for sustainable and renewable materials while reducing the dependency to the extraction and processing of raw materials through application of mushroom mycelium as a natural binder to bind wood waste and agricultural waste by-products to create innovative, bio-based, and circular materials as alternative to freshly cut timber from our forest.","Biowerkz has an IP-heavy Asset-light business strategy. There are two revenue streams that are explained below:
1- Biowerkz partners with companies from wood and furniture and agriculture industries and collect their by-products and waste stream. The waste streams then will be processed further into mycelium based formulations at Biowerk partner mushroom farms. Biowerkz then transport the treated waste from its mushroom farm partners to its production facility where NEWood panels/boards are produced following the patented process developed by Biowerkz. NEWood semi-finished boards are then sold to customers who are contractors, building developers, furniture manufacturers or Interior designers. Biowerkz makes revenue through the sales of NEWood to various customers segments.
2- Biowerkz forms Joint Venture company with its potential partners from Wood and furniture industries. Biowerkz will have a stake in the JV while also makes revenue by licensing its technology to the JV. The JV then produces NEWood panels/parts for the range of customers whom are determined by the JV partners based on their market demand and market access. Through this process Biowerkz reduces its risks and will have two revenue streams.","Biowerkz patented process is the result of close to 5 years research and development works in Singapore and Germany.
The IP has been already filed to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, as the research university where the spin off company Biowerz comes from.  The patent submission is currently under way. However it is confirmed that Biowerz will be able to have an exclusive license from KIT university and with a potential to take over ownership after certain milestones are fulfilled.","Given the fact that Biowerkz is an early stage startup, commercial application of NEWood has not yet been possible. However the team has completed a proof-of-concept project as a self-sustainable modular home, in Indonesian island of Batam, where NEWood panels are used as interior wall replacing the traditional wooden walls/partition walls. Also NEWood has been in various exhibitions in Berlin, Singapore and Zurich. Currently Biowerkz is working with three pilot project partners from construction and furniture industries and these partners will be able to employ NEWood in their projects once the pilot projects are successfully completed.","Employing OSB, MDF, Particleboards and similar engineered wood products within the construction industry does not come without consequences. Firstly, about a third of the wood extracted from natural forests worldwide is used for timber products. Today, timber harvesting is a major driver for deforestation across Europe which has led to adverse impacts on climate change and the environment. Secondly, the type of adhesives used to bind the wood particles and fibers create another challenge when it comes to environmental impacts from use of such products. Particleboards and Medium Density Fiber (MDF) boards are widely used within construction sector and are produced using mainly urea formaldehyde (UF) based adhesives. However, UF adhesives are known to produce formaldehyde emissions which is harmful to human health and their production rely primarily on non-renewable resources, thus they are not environmentally friendly, nor biodegradable and can increase the waste production at the end of their usage. Therefore, we need to think more radically with regards to development of more sustainable, material-efficient, and circular products for construction industry which replace products such as particleboards, MDF boards and even plastics.
With this fact in mind, Biowerkz addresses the above-mentioned challenges to establish new materials and production techniques that can address the demand for sustainable, high-performance, and affordable construction and furniture materials. our aim is to utilizes the million tons of organic waste in the form of wood waste and agricultural waste available as by-products of timber, food and agricultural industries and transform them with the power of fungi mycelium following a circular economy model into biobased and sustainable products with similar or better properties as alternative to OSB, MDF and particleboards used manly within construction and furniture industry. The novel process developed at Biowerkz allows the industry to move towards a circular economy model, thus leaving no waste behind.",BIOWERKZ,1-Jul-23,2 - Manufacturing concepts identified,501.000 to 1.000.000,"English, German",8_P,TRL 4 – technology validated in lab,"Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany","Forestry, Pulp, Paper, Plastics, Materials, Textiles",Nazanin,Saeidi,CEO,https://de.linkedin.com/in/nazanin-saeidi,Yean,Ong,COO,https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ongyeanchau,,,,,

At this stage, several complementary partnerships are being experimented on with an agile approach. We present here one pillar of Shiso &amp; Cie, which aims at developing a French industry/ecosystem of the Perilla frutescens plant species (Shiso is the Japanese name for this plant originating from Asia).
The Perilla is well-known in Asia. From its seeds is extracted an oil that has exceptional content of omega-3 fatty acid, one essential element that the occidental diet lacks. From its leaves are extracted essential oils that have a wide range of usages, from cosmetics or natural-care to bio-control (in agriculture), through perfumery. Leaves have also interests in Agro-alimentary sector (food colouring, taste, infusions…).
Perilla frutescens fits well in regenerative agriculture: sober plant (water, pesticides), adapted to warm temperatures, melliferous, host to bio-diversity, structuring roots for the soils. This is a good 6-months crop to include in rotation cycles of traditional or organic agriculture, with economical and ecological benefits.
To promote the use of this plant, Shiso &amp; Cie works on each level of the chain: (i) our strong value lies on genetics and seed production: we create, select for, produce and sell Perilla seed varieties that are adapted to the different usages and French territories. (ii) we want to develop our own processing factory for vegetal oil (from seeds) and essential oils (from leaves). The purpose of this pilot factory is dual: an agile R&amp;D basis for our partnerships with industry companies, and a small-scale production of high-quality oils to sell directly. (iii) co-creation and sales of B2C products: participating in making Shiso better known in France or Europe, and selling products with French origin to Asia.","Asian market for Shiso products from France exists, while Western markets are emerging. Thus our challenge is mainly to build up the production network together with the market shares. We have the know-how and want to set up our production line.
A strong point we have is that we own our genetics and manage seed and production network with farmers.
Risk is low, our approach is agile and business-driven, explaining the relatively modest investment range requested.
The potential market is great.","Our intended revenue model relies on (% of turnover is an indication for the first years)

# Selling vegetal oils: 90% of turnover
# Selling essential oils: 8% of turnover",#NAME?,"# Our seeds are being sold
# We are in discussion regarding Vegetal Oil and Essential Oils
# We are in discussion regarding R&amp;D on Essential Oil for bio-control","We believe that developing Shiso crop in France will help at several levels:
Locally, for farmers producing Shiso, the crop brings economical and ecological benefits. To us, it is essential to offer positive innovations to restore the eco-systems, bring resilience in the context of climatic change, while re-valorising the work of farmers in the value chains.
For consumers, health benefits from Shiso products are numerous and can touch human or animals, food or well-being. It is essential to increase the content of omega-3 fatty acid in our occidental diet. Various specific health benefits are drawn from essential oils also.
For industrials, Shiso ingredients produced in France represent an opportunity to work with stable partners, good traceability, less carbon footprint, and possibly, custom products (the contents of molecules of interest vary according to the Shiso variety that is cultivated)
For the Asian market, Shiso ingredients produced in France represent an added value for traceability, quality and marketing.
For the agricultural sector, bio-control solutions (helping control pests or diseases in crop from natural molecules) are needed to help decreasing the use of conventional pesticides.

Type 3c, or pancreatogenic, diabetes (T3cD) accounts for as much as 9% of all diabetes cases. There are no common treatment guidelines for T3cD other than diet and insulin which can result in deadly hypoglycemic events. Better management is a significant unmet need. Our novel new T3cD therapy is a subcutaneous injection that works for 4-6 months producing: significantly lower hypoglycemia risk &amp; insulin needs, moderation of glucose excursions, increased insulin sensitivity and better health.
T3cD is usually managed by insulin, diet and sometimes metformin. Our approach is novel &amp; innovative in every way compared with this current care. We are developing a long-acting, extended release, subcutaneous injection delivering a 4-6 month continuous supply of a novel &amp; safe therapeutic analog of pancreatic polypeptide (PP).  Our PP analog already has an IND and will go straight to clinical trials.
Reduced pancreatic endocrine function in T3cD affects PP levels as well as insulin. Among several functions, PP increases the liver’s insulin sensitivity, reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver, and resulting in fewer swings in blood sugar levels. This in turn, decreases insulin requirements and, significantly, the risk of deadly hypoglycemia. This has been demonstrated in both animal models &amp; human trials of T3cD and chronic pancreatitis.  For the first time, we make the exceptional life-saving treatment potential of PP feasible, practical &amp; convenient.","A treatment of Type 3c diabetes is a significant unmet need.  There are no dedicated treatments available. Compared to current care, we offer better control and management of blood sugar levels and we significantly reduce the serious, deadly risks of T3cDM. We save and dramatically improve quality of lives with this under-served condition. In addition, our product offers advantages for patient adherence to the therapy and for patient convenience, as our product is administered just every 4-6 months.  We can develop this rapidly, and move immediately into Phase 1 Clinical trials. Our potential market is large and growing, with limited, if any, direct competition.","The marketing of this product is a few years off, but the message to healthcare providers, payors and potential patients is clear: ""This could save your life""  Our therapy offers much improved management of blood glucose levels, significantly reducing the extent of glucose excursions, reduce the amount and frequency of your insulin requirements and significantly reduce the risk life-endangering hypoglycemia.  We will reduce the risk of the serious cardiovascular and neuropathic complications and co-morbidities and help you live a better, healthier, longer life. We anticipate that we will being taking that message to healthcare providers early on in preparation for market introduction.  We would continue to reinforce that message, and once regulatory approval is secured, seeding this message in the diabetes community, in publications and on-line, to build awareness in the patient populations.
We will most likely reach our customers through healthcare providers, and hospitals and clinics that cater to patients with diabetes and pancreatic disease.  As this will be a  pharmaceutical product it will be available by prescription.  We currently expect that the product will be administered by a healthcare provider so distribution will most likely be through typical pharmaceutical distribution channels, hospitals, clinics and other providers facilities.
We anticipate, however, that we will realize an exit to a large pharmaceutical company before the therapy achieves pharmaceutical marketing approvals.",The peptide analog and a key excipient of the formulation are covered by patents.  We are licensing these IP from our partner organizations. We plan to file additional patents on our formulation and application as well as potentially for an efficient new production method for the peptide analog.,"Our excipient technology is currently used and in development for other, unrelated indications.","Type 3c, or pancreatogenic, diabetes refers to diabetes caused by exocrine pancreatic disease, surgery or trauma to the pancreas resulting uniquely in reduced pancreatic endocrine function including reduced amounts of Pancreatic Polypeptide. It is often misdiagnosed as Type 2 DM. There are no current common guidelines for T3cDM treatment and no treatments available specifically for T3cDM. Currently, advanced cases require insulin, milder cases are managed with diet and sometimes metformin, if tolerated. These are broadly insufficient. Treating T3cD with insulin can be dangerous as it can lead to deadly hypoglycemic events as reduced production of glucagon, a hormone responsible for increasing glucose into the blood with hypoglycemia, also presents. Incretin-based, e.g., GLP-1 RA's &amp; SGLT2i therapies for type 2 diabetes are not recommended, yet the serious complications of T3cD are the same as for type 2 diabetes. Better management &amp; treatment of T3cDM is a significant unmet need.T3cD is estimated to account for 8-9% of all diabetes cases in industrialized, western countries, or more than 7.5 million cases. The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis, a leading cause of T3cD, is 50 in 100,000 people.  If we focus on patients with chronic pancreatitis in these countries, we will have an initial target market that will generate annual, recurring revenues of $300-500 million and grow from there.

The first solution developed by O2W values the used  vegetable cooking oils (UCO) in vegetable wax for different applications and rolled out its first products commercially: ready made decorative scented candles and Ecological candles DIY Kits. These ecological products are made from UCOs and offer to its users unique benefits as a product and as a solution as well.
As a product offers to its users a biodegradable, no toxic, safe and a long burning fragranced vegetable candle.
As a solution delivers a big positive impact by avoiding the consumption of natural resources, preventing the contamination of ecosystems, do not add new carbon to atmosphere, reducing the consumption of energy as of a traditional distribution chain, eliminating the operating costs in the treatment of this waste among others.
For all these reasons, we call them The Greatest Candles In The World and aim to make people feel the scent of doing good.

Furthermore, our catalysts do not require extensive purification of the monomer as in the current industrial process. Furthermore, our obtained PLA also does not require a purification process to remove unreacted monomer, as all of it is converted.
Furthermore, this technology opens the way to solving the problem of plastic waste, as several polyesters and other conventional plastics can be depolymerised, i.e. chemically recycled, to obtain the raw materials needed for their production.","The price of commercial bioplastics is still higher than oil-based plastics. However, the current price of commercial bioplastics is around 3-5 €/kg. Moreover, the commercial formulations and productive process to produce these commercial bioplastics are not entirely developed and still many optimizations can be performed. In this respect, research and development has a strong implication to develop new processes and materials. Therefore, our goal is to achieve selling cheaper bioplastics with improved properties in respect with the commercial ones.
Our competitive advantage resides mainly in the reduction of production costs thanks to our polymerization catalysts. Currently, commercial PLA is obtained using a toxic tin catalyst through prolonged reactions that require many purification processes for raw materials and products, and high temperatures. These factors mean that the production of this and other bioplastics have very high energy costs, so any innovative process that saves costs will be welcome in the industry.
Our catalysts are very robust, being able to carry out the reaction in much less restrictive conditions of humidity and oxygen, in just one minute, at room temperature, using solvents that can be recirculated and reused infinite times, and achieving the total transformation of the raw materials into bioplastics.
Therefore, our technology allows an increase in the productive capacity of an existing facility, improves the use of resources, and a very significant reduction in energy costs.","ES2610432_A1 (granted), P202230965 (registered).","Many polymerization catalysts have been developed to work in solution, however none of them had a chance to reach the market.

PROBLEM
The dairy industry is responsible for twice the emissions of the aviation sector. This is why consumers are seeking sustainable, regional alternatives. While booming, conventional packaged oat milk only partially meets this trend. The food services industry stays unsatisfied with packaging waste and pricing, wanting to offer fresher experiences.
SOLUTION
We develop high-quality machines for fresh and sustainable on-site food production. Our first product is unlocking the $123 Billion future vegan milk market by addressing packaging and freshness concerns with a B2B oat drink machine, The Oater Barista. We offer a subscription for our ingredient mix needed to produce oat milk on-site in the machine.","While our competitors also actively solve for the packaging and sustainability problem, they neglect the milk taste and foam, which we guarantee through our innovative, patent-pending low-temperature fermentation process, among other advantages.","We offer a holistic oat milk ecosystem, which in addition to the machine also consists of a smart ordering platform and the regular delivery of ingredients (,,Oater Packs""). The business model is ,,oat milk as a service"". Our business customers, including cafes and retailers, borrow the machine for free and pay only one price per liter for the delivery of raw ingredients (fixed price 1.40 €/l results in 54 % Gross Profit Margin). This model ensures constant revenue streams and higher scaling potential than traditional hardware models. It also guarantees minimal barriers to entry for our price- and risk-sensitive customers. A machine reaches full cost recovery after about one year with an average consumption of 4,200 liters per year.","We have developed an innovative single-batch low-temperature fermentation process and apparatus for the production of plant-based milk and have submitted our German patent application in 01/2023 which we will expand EU-wide and internationally. This secures us the exclusive use of the hyper-centralized plant-based milk production technology. With our patent, we create market entry hurdles for comparable machines and ensure our dominant position as the only ingredient supplier for our machine.
As part of our vision, we aim to expand our on-site production innovations to other dairy alternatives and will likely patent these in the future.","Even prior to our market launch and without active sales, we grew our waitlist to 37 customers. Of these, we are focusing on key strategic partnerships and acquisition channels, including a development and sales cooperation with one of the globally most integrated coffee machine manufacturer, a leading canteen supplier, a leading food producer, and a leading distribution company for coffee and other gastro machines. Pilot projects will start in Q2 2023.","Our first product, The Oater Barista, is made for cafés, hotels, offices, and no-waste stores. This initial market helps us to establish a brand and develop further product categories. After developing a second, larger version of the machine in 2024, the ‘The Oater Retail +’, we will also sell B2C and tap into the entire multi-billion-dollar oat milk market, before expanding even beyond oat milk.
Both machines use our innovative, patent-pending low-temperature fermentation process to produce market-leading oat milk in Barista-quality with no pasteurization. We have understood that Barista quality foam and natural sweetness without added sugar are a requirement among B2B customers. While our competitors also actively solve for the packaging and sustainability problem, they neglect the milk taste and foam. This makes us the only sustainable alternative adept to compete in the food services segment with the best consumer experience.
Our initial customer group consisting of small business owners and baristas are currently forced to keep using packaged brand oat milk. It is the only product that meets their foam and taste requirements regardless of how dissatisfied they are with packaging, pricing, supply chain issues etc. Many businesses have tried making their own oat milk, either manually or with the aid of consumer kitchen appliances. However, they have all returned to the packaged oat milk due to the complexity and manual nature of the production process which is not feasible for a fast-paced food services workflow as well as the lack of barista quality (foam + harmonic taste with coffee).
All customer groups, including retail, have the key challenge of attracting people to their stores, and our fresh, high-quality product enables them to offer a unique experience, thereby growing their business overall.",THE OATER (OIY SOLUTIONS GMBH),29-Oct-21,6 - Capability to produce a prototype system or subsystem in a production relevant environment,501.000 to 1.000.000,"English, German",36_P,TRL 7 – system prototype demonstration in operational environment,"Köln, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Deutschland",Foodtech,Sarah,Nesti,Co-Founder &amp; CEO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-nesti/,Henrik,Burger,Co-Founder &amp; CFO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikburger/,Benjamin,Auer,Co-Founder &amp; CPO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/auerbenjamin/,https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxpglgLFkfs?feature=oembed

Working directly with farmers, we start from the raw material, hemp, a local and ecological resource : France is the first European producer of this plant which grows quickly, generally without irrigation or chemicals, while welcoming biodiversity and massively capturing carbon. In rotation cycle it helps regenerating the soils and improves following crops’ yield.
As an alternative supply or in combination, we can use flax and reed, from French farmers too.
More specifically, we use oilseed hemp and flax, enabling farmers to combine the seeds’ markets (healthy food, cosmetics) while we collect the stems for Iroony. This circular approach also results in an optimized use of arable land.
Then we use biochemistry to extract the different components, in particular the cellulose. This is the core of our project and R&amp;D : thanks to our own process, the resulted hemp / flax cellulose is suitable to be further transformed into fibers, and filament through technologies of dissolution and regeneration.
The most widespread is Viscose, followed by Lyocell, but we mainly now study ionic liquid based technologies such as High per Cell.
As the resulted Iroony materials combine the assets of both hemp and cellulose-regenerated fibres, they meet the growing expectations of the textiles, clothing and footwear companies, which are sustainability requirements (low use of natural resources, no micro-plastics release, natural ecosystems protection), local production, and performance such as high fineness, resistance or versatility.
Our goal is to set-up a new value chain starting from the farmers. We will buy hemp and flax stems and then industrially transform this raw material into Iroony, an alternative to petrochemistry materials (polyester…), industrial cotton or wood-based viscose. Iroony will be sold to European textile sectors such as spinning, non-woven companies and packaging companies.","Because it's not an idea anymore, we made it real and attracted customers.

In order to degrade or compost such materials, appropriate conditions are required in industrial composting plants - in Poland there is not a single composting plant that would be able to degrade bioplastic, in the USA such composting plants, are less than 50, account for 1% of the total. For the production of these plastics, food resources are needed (e.g. 2.6 kg of corn are needed to produce 1 kg of bioplastic), which is not the best use of food.
Our team creates innovative and modern material in an advanced biotechnological process. It is produced intracellularly by bacteria; is mechanically and physically similar to popular plastics (e.g. polypropylene and polyethylene); biodegrades by microbial contamination under all conditions (colloquially speaking, it is eaten by other microorganisms living e.g. in soil, sea, ocean, forest etc.), where it will leave behind compost and microelements at the end. We produce them from waste from the agriculture or food industry. It is in line with the trends of ""zero waste"", closed cycle, ecology, reduction of CO2 emissions.
In 2021, more than 17m tons of plastic went to the oceans, people eat up to 18kg of plastic in the form of microplastics during their lifetime, CO2 in the atmosphere increases drastically and causes global warming. Many countries around the world ban single-use plastic, which forces the market to switch to greener solutions. This is the perfect time for this type of activity.
A given material can be used in many industries - e.g. cosmetics, it is the industry that most quickly follows the ecological trends that are required by their customers.

(PBI) is focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing Nanofibrillated Cellulose (NFC) fibril additives, which are an exciting sustainable nanostructured biomaterial produced from Canadian forest feedstocks, that deliver significant strength enhancements and unique rheology modifications in a broad range of applications.
We concentrate on application development in key industries including concrete and mortars, nonwoven materials, polymer materials, industrial fluids, and other performance driven domains where significant benefits from NFC addition have been demonstrated.
We are active with a wide range of technical development activities where we support customer evaluations of NFC, collaborate on joint developments to tailor and customize NFC properties, and we assist with implementations of NFC within customers’ products and processes.
In terms of business development activities, we are actively seeking innovation leaders globally in advanced materials and specialty chemicals to evaluate, and purchase, NFC to enhance their product performance, process efficiencies, and increase sustainability content.","We believe Nanofibrillated Cellulose is a sustainable alternative to a number of fossil-fuel based additives used in construction, automotive, aerospace, energy, manufacturing, mining, consumer goods, and countless other performance-driven applications where significant pressures are mounting to improve the sustainability profile of given products and materials.
The process to manufacture Nanofibrillated Cellulose has been proven and is currently scaling to commercial volumes (facility online estimated November 2022).
The benefits of Nanofibrillated Cellulose have been demonstrated in a broad range applications within our target markets and we have received green-light approvals that purchase orders are pending from major ""lighthouse"" customers within our target markets.","Our current go-to-market strategy comprises a segmented approach to focus on the optimal channels/paths for our Nanofibrillated Cellulose additives to reach the target markets.
For the concrete &amp; cementitious materials domain we will be selling Nanofibrillated Cellulose to Admixture companies (who create specialized chemistry packages that tailor the properties of concrete and cements).  We are currently working with some of the world's largest Admixture companies to help them create new products that incorporate Nanofibrillated Cellulose and that they will provide to concrete and cements materials producers on a global basis. The concrete and cements domain is presently facing substantial pressure to improve its sustainability footprint and Nanofibrillated Cellulose helps to increase the durability and service life of concrete which means buildings and structures will last much longer and can avoid replacement (and avoid the negative environmental impact of replacement).
For the other key domains (polymers, nonwovens, and industrial fluids) we will be selling to the primary materials producers who will incorporate Nanofibrillated Cellulose into their materials and then will sell these materials to converters, who transform the given materials into finished products and finished goods. These domains are also facing major pressures to improve sustainability in addition to constantly being driven to enhance product performance and process efficiencies; and Nanofibrillated Cellulose delivers a range of value propositions in these domains.","Our IP strategy is to file patents on modifications (e.g. chemical functionalizations) to Nanofibrillated Cellulose that enable it to deliver greater benefits to strength and rheology and/or enable the fibrils themselves to have different physical, mechanical, or chemical properties.
In addition our IP strategy is to selectively file patents on applications of Nanofibrillated Cellulose.  An example here includes a patent we filed for Improved Repair Mortars for Concrete Structures where Nanofibrillated Cellulose significantly improves the bonding strength of the overlay repair material (repair mortar) that is used to patch degrading concrete structures.","Our major milestones in the past 6-12 months have been to secure lab evaluations and pilot/field trials with key customers within our target markets; and to receive positive (""go forward / commercialization green-light"") responses from a number of these customers.","For innovation leaders in advanced materials and specialty chemicals who need to enhance product performance, improve process efficiency, and increase sustainability content, we have developed Nanofibrillated Cellulose additives (sustainable nanostructured cellulose fibrils) that help deliver strength gains and rheology modifications for concrete and cementitious materials, polymer based materials, nonwoven materials, industrial fluids, and other performance-driven domains.",PERFORMANCE BIOFILAMENTS,,9 - Low-rate production demonstrated.

Configured as a transport robot, it supports harvesting work in fruit and vegetable cultivation. Up to 30% of the harvesting time is consumed by people transporting boxes off the field. The robot can autonomously transport full boxes from field workers to central collection points safely across the field, where they are loaded onto large trailers. This increases the productivity by 30-40%, while reducing physical stress on the workers and soil compaction. With our collaborativ robots, we are not replacing workers, but leverage them and increase the resilience against shortages of seasonal workers. Additionally we are bringing affordable and practical robotic systems into the fieldwork, step by step, without changing the whole process at once, de-risiking the transistion towards robotics and making it much more appealing for farmers to test and integrate into their existing harvesting process.  We are currently running pilot project and start delivering our first pre series batch the coming season.","With our collaborative transportplatform we are bring practical solutions to the fields – now. This gives us the advantage of spreading our robots throughout the fields, while having the perspective to use our transportation technology as the base for further automation like weeding and harvesting.",We are selling the transport robot for a fixed price. Additionally there is a yearly subscription fee for support and software updates. As this approach is giving us the necessary liquidity to finance production. Down the road we are decreasing the fixed prices more and more and increase the annual subscription in order to increase our recurring revenue.,Our main IP lies within the software stack.,"We have been running pilot projects with strawberry farmes the last months. The robot was running autonomously all day, increasing productivity between 25-35% from day 1. We were able to proof that our technology stack is working, that there is a significant productivity gain, and that the user experience is simple and quickly adapted by the pickers. This pilot project is the current foundation for our ongoing negotiations for a pre-series order for next year as well as negotiations over a total volume of 100 robots in the next 3-4 years.","We are starting with the strawberry growers in Germany. They are facing immense labor shortages and increasing wages is putting tremendous pressure on the farms. As labor is responsible for over half the production costs -they are facing 200m€ annual in labor costs, resulting in a 30m€ annual potential for us. From this go2market we are expanding into europe, leading to a annual potential of 248m€.

Right now the widespread usage of antibiotics in livestock relates to a value of around 15  billion Euro globally.
Antibiotic resistance not only visible in animals but also in farmers is dramatically increasing.
Productivity still overrules welfare and the needed high performance does not support any changes.
We as Corbiota want to redefine industrial animal nutrition by introducing a natural solution backed by science. We feed special live worms to young animals right at the beginning of the rearing period to transfer complex microbiota.
When administered to young animals such as chicks but also piglets they enable optimal health and growth. Specifically they support the eubiosis, the natural balance of microorganisms in the gut.
To ensure the high quality of our proprietary solutions we strongly believe in innovation based and dynamic R&amp;D.
we conducted several scientific trials with well-known institutes and already fed live worms to over 600.000 chicks. Further trials, also with piglets, are currently ongoing.
In our trials we could highlight:
 improved weight gain and feed conversion.
 better immune system of animals and thereby reduce mortality
and reduction of pododermatitis.
increase animals’ agility of up to 21% which is a huge improvement of animal welfare.
Our Products are QS and GMP+ listed and produced pathogen free following special Corbiota guidelines in Germany
Our Production is fully automated and AI controlled, build on vertical farming concept and has a positive CO2 balance. In addition we produce zero waste as our „waste product“ is high quality vermicompost.
Over the next years we will not only launch in other countries globally but also  transfer the knowledge to other species and products.","Our product is pathogen free, natural and can strengthen animal health and wellfare without additional 'non natural' additives or products. Studies show lower mortality, less medication need, improved food conversion rate and ROI for farmers of 3 and above.
Corbiota aims to create a more sustainable modern farming by providing young animals with natural and animal-friendly nutrition. Feeding young animals with Corbiota’s earthworms strengthens their eubiosis, the natural balance of microorganisms in their gut and immune system and triggers their natural instincts. They grow up stronger, healthier and more resistant towards diseases, reducing the need for antibiotics treatment - one of the biggest global challenges in today’s farming.
in addition Corbiota develops solitions within its vision for sustainable, natural and animal friendliy nutrition also for companion animals.
Corbiota holds international patents for its solution and all products are pathogen free.
Products are listed for sales in all EU countries and regulatory processes have been finished - approval has been granted.","Our direct customers are meet processing industries (integrators), Chicken, Piglet fattening and producer goups, veterierians - all of these groups have been talked to. Even prior regulatory approval we had the possibility to sell via special access - what we did. Customers like our product and see trial outcomes in their daily practice as well.
Our Secondary customers are politics, system gastronomy, retail and feed manufacturers, who are under high pressure to increase animal wellfare but also to manage costs due to high energy and wheat costs. Also these customer groups are in favour for our solution due to the fact that ROI is proven and invest turns out into revenue and better ebit.
We sell lifeworms (self produced) to those customers which is reoccurring business. For future product options we talk about dried products selling via ""Landhändler"" or distributors as dried products are easier to store than live worms.","yes, we have 7 patents filed, where 1 is already published related to various solutions and processes, including manufacturing","yes, we have first customers in fattening field (poultry) and running first trials for piglets as well.","animal wellfare improvement by law - farmers have to rebuild stallions, changing breed etc. All high price solutions.

Circular Fiber is built on the idea to re-use the agro-food waste in order to bring a new concept of environmental sustainability for everyone’s daily life. The initial focus of the technical team is the waste derived by the artichokes industry. The waste will be enhanced and regenerated in edible flour which will then constitute one of the various possible finished products deriving from starchy products (i.e pasta, bread sticks, bread). There is a massive waste from the industrial transformation of the artichokes. Agricultural waste is at a value of 75% in case of the production of the “artichoke hearts”. One of the main objectives of the project is to promote interest in the circular economy through the enhancement of agri-food waste and the defense of the territory and its biodiversity.
The market opportunity we saw was to transform a highly perishable product, such as artichoke’s waste, into a product such as flour which, after an innovative manufacturing process, has a life span up to three years.","The artichoke has always been known for its purifying and digestive properties and its flour therefore fits well in a context of products dedicated to nutraceuticals.
Through the circular economy, we would like to bring innovative and alternative products to the market and make them (over time) usable by all.
The recovery and enhancement of waste to obtain new commercially useful products, is a pillar of the circular economy and global sustainability.","The beachhead market initially is represented by the “special mill flours” for finished starchy products (i.e.: pasta, bread sticks, bread). The pasta industry represents one of the biggest sector of the Italian food industry in the global competition.

This could lead us to elaborate a strategic vision aimed at protecting the value of our company, its potential, its mission and its social impact.
The inspired model we aim is KAMUT International, the copyright and the protection of the trademark clearly identifies Kamut as specific special flour.
The products that can use artichoke flour will be:

Plan to create a high-tech farm – Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) for breeding valuable fish species and obtaining caviar. RAS mean-extract of caviar (without killing the fish) to finished product (fish) takes place in a building with certain specified square area. Cost of farm turnkey – 2 million euros. The main reason for siting in Kyrgyzstan – an excellent ecological situation, natural water does not require a huge financial cost of filtration and enrichment.
 Product or service description (incl. current status of development – beta, prototype, etc.)
RAS is fishery project – Recirculating  Aquaculture System .There are chain of pools indoor and filtered water is supplied .That water flows in circle.  Vaporized water replaces.
Also water cleans up during the whole process because of it constant circuit flow.  That makes the product (fish and etc) healthy, environmentally friendly and meets the worldwide Health standards. Suppliers of equipment and major assemblies German companies with a worldwide reputation . Using that system we plan to breed following kinds of fish: sturgeon, eel, trout, burbot (eelpout) etc
Environmental side of the project is does not require the construction of large ponds, reservoirs in the open, in which control of water (evaporation and seepage into the soil) is very difficult and even unrealistic, which leads to a change in the climate of the region for the worse. Some data on aquaculture, pond farming occupies 1 hectare has a capacity of 5-7 tons of fish a year, and RAS farm in 1000-1500 m2 has productivity of 60-100-120 tons of fish per year","Market of fish – seafood consumption are inanimate in Kyrgyzstan, it is connected with traditions -habit  which is not formed because of the lack of seafood, therefore, the bulk of production will be exported. In this pilot version of the farm, the main importer – consignee of the finished product – live fish will be grantor, predetermined percentage of products will go to offset the amount of the grant. These types of fish such as sturgeon, eel, burbot and sturgeon caviar are not difficult to implement. The sale will be provisional production order.
 Sales and Marketing Plan (how you will go-to-market)
The production capacity of the pilot farm is low for the world market, and purpose of this farm to attract more investment by the Japanese corporation Mitsui Bussan.

We are currently focussed on a technology which will allow co-streams from food production to be processed into higher value nutritious plant based food. Using local supply chains for a local market. Our technology will enable food producers to maximise co-products and waste streams to create plant protein based products.
We are based in Nottingham, UK and have developed a range of food ingredients from co-streams such as oil seed cake (e.g. hemp) which can be used by food manufacturers, food service or brands. We are also developing a consumer range to showcase the ingredients which will move plant based proteins away from meat mimicry such as sausages and burgers by developing new concepts to replace but not pretend to be meat.
We are a small team with a food grade laboratory and plenty of food science and culinary experience.","We plan to revolutionize the way we view plant based proteins. Moving away from the traditional meat mimicry using soy, pea and wheat isolates to a wider variety of crops. This can be used for the traditional plant based products (sausages, burgers etc) but our vision is to create a new way to eat these products which is healthy, tasty and sustainable. We want to celebrate the  plants and vegetables going into our products rather than hide them. We want to demonstrate that there is a new eating experience with a range of new ingredients. Our B2C range will showcase this.
We aim to make a global difference by enabling local farmers to process their proteins into nutritious products for human consumption and use the entire plant. This is our long term vision to ensure that food waste and monocropping can be reduced and health of the products sold globally is improved.","The business model will rely on product sales initially. B2B will deliver the first sales via distributors whom we are already in discussion with. The B2C brand will follow but likely to be a smaller % of the revenues.
Eventually a global model will involve the technology being licensed out to manufacturers to use local protein co-streams to produce protein for the local market on a global scale.",None at present. IP will be registered on completion of our proof of content trials.,"The use of TVP is well known in the food industry and the plant based meat sector has been built up around this technology. However, our use of the technology to use co-products and whole ingredients to produce TVP is new and has not been used previously. This will open up the sector beyond the small number of protein isolates currently in use to enable healthier more environmentally friendly ingredients to be used.
We intent to use local protein sources to supply local markets on a global scale. In this way reducing the impact plant based meats, monocropping and transportation of TVP is having on the environment, making plant based proteins a truly environmentally friendly alternative to meat.","We are focussed on producing solutions for the plant based protein food market. Currrently, the overwhelming majority of plant based products are produced using soy, pea or wheat protein isolates in textured vegetable proteins (TVP). This has issues for the taste of the product, the environment (monocropping, use of amazon to grow soy) and the health of consumers. We aim to bring other plant based proteins to market, not using isolates but using co-streams and feedstocks which are closer to whole ingredients. This is to widen the range of ingredients available, improve the nutrition and improve the taste.
We are focused on providing solutions for customers such as ingredient distributors, food service providers and manufacturers in the form of a raw ingredient to be added to products. We are also launching a consumer brand to showcase the ingredients we produce.

We have been hearing a lot recently about soil regeneration, increasing their biodiversity, carbon sequestration, counteracting negative climate change and increasing yields by reducing the amount of fertilizers and pesticides used.

Our ingredients, framed within the alternative protein market, have a higher nutritional profile than other plant-based ones, as well as technological properties of great interest to the food industry, such as foaming, gelling and emulsifying activities.
At MOA, we believe that the food industry can meet the demands of our growing population without jeopardising our future. Currently, agricultural expansion is responsible for 80% of deforestation, 77% of which is used as animal feed. In addition, the food industry is responsible for 24% of GHG emissions. With a population of 10 billion people expected by 2050, global protein demand will increase by 70%, while resource extraction can only increase by 10%.
So, at MOA, we valorise food by-products and reintroduce them into the food chain to provide a 100% sustainable product to replace animal and plant-based protein, not only because we don’t need to extract more resources from the environment, but also because it allows us to reduce the impact of food industry waste on ecosystems and its own efficiency.
From the by-products, we create cheap and sustainable culture media and ferment them using one or more of the microorganisms in our library. Using an artificial intelligence tool of our own creation, we choose the right microorganism for the by-product and the client’s needs, saving research time.
The result is a microbial biomass that we can sell directly or treat to select the necessary technological properties or composition.","MOA was created to solve the biggest challenges society is currently facing, and the solution it proposes combines two of the most promising tools of our time: artificial intelligence and biotechnology, in a clear example of the circular economy.","Currently, our activity is based on the research and development of new processes adapted to companies seeking to upcycle their by-products, either to use the new products obtained in their own processes or to sell them to food companies. Our revenues will come from our I+D+i projects and from the sales of licensed ingredients produced by our clients.
However, our aim is to start industrial production at the end of 2022. From this point on, our revenues will come both from sales of our product and from licensing our valorisation processes and ingredient production.","For us, intellectual property is one of the pillars of our company, as we base our value on the research we carry out. For this reason, we have been working towards obtaining patents for our process, for which we are in contact with advisors with extensive experience in the sector. As we have not applied for any patents so far, we rely on other mechanisms such as non-disclosure agreements and industry secrecy for the time being.","Our technology, as a method of revalorising food by-products, has been applied: on a laboratory scale, in the bakery and Italian pasta sectors, breweries and vegetable oils, and on a pilot scale, for the moment it has only been tested with molasses from the sugar industry.
On the other hand, only one of the prototypes we are working with has been tested in food industry processes, producing an interesting meat analogue through its inclusion in a soya matrix, providing improved flavour and texture.

Once we consume enough volume this matter will be arranged contractually.","Spirulina is traditionally grown in open pond-like structures, often in Asia, and hence very sensitive to contamination from dust and bird manure. For transport and food safety reasons the microalgae must be dried before brought to the market.

The platform encourages of the use of fresh and locally sourced ingredients that are in season at a given time.
The options are a construct of objectives set by clients- stamina, growth, maintainment. In addition, there is a strong focus on mental health and healthy body.

Moreover, it promotes the use of local and seasonal products, thus ensuring the proposal of just what our bodies need and to what we have adapted to for generations.","The proposed solution is the creation of a smart platform that changes the paradigm regarding the way people order takeout. Thus the objective is to develop a matching system between the preferences and specific needs of each user through a culinary profile. The options contained on the platform are not limited by Nutriento but are rather vast, containing options from a number of local restaurants that follow and comply to listing the nutritional values of their products and follow a healthy concept. Through a subscription based model compared to a one order delivery option we manage to optimize costs not only for restaurants as they are better able to plan their production needs and operation costs, but we also contribute to lowering the carbon footprint by optimizing transportation of products to customers. A feedback mechanism will contribute to the constant development and matching between the needs and preferences of the user to the local offer of restaurants.
The overall objective of the proposal is to develop a new product- a web platform that offers a solution to personalize healthy meals that aim to contribute to a healthy lifestyle and reaching set goals of users. The proposal therefore supports the development of synergies for partners that will join the platform, the use of seasonal ingredients, having a lower impact on the environment, growing life expectancy and more.
The objectives that need to be met are:
1.	The identification of necessary technical solutions and processes that ensure the development of the Nutriento platform in a 4 month timeframe
2.	The development of a new product- the Nutriento platform- a 7 month timeframe
3.	Having 100 profiles created by users in order a 5 day subscription to test and validate the concept- a 2 month period timeframe and collect feedback from at least 10% of them
4.	The implementation of a marketing strategy to advertise and endorse the developed platform.
The validation of the need of such a product on the market will be done by:
1.	Enrolling a number of minimum 5 restaurants on the platform
2.	Delivering subscription orders to a number of minimum 20 users
3.	Have a retention rate of at least 50% of users that sign up for a following subscription.
The revenue generated by the platform is described below:
Restaurants: have a 15-25% commission for the products they sell via the platform;
Monthly target: for a minimum of 10 000 lei sold by a restaurant through the platform, the commission will be lower- 15%, and for any sum under 10 000 lei, the commission will reach 25%. This is an incentive mainly offered to restaurants in order to promote the platform in return.

agricultural use. ClearLeaf currently has pre and postharvest solutions for coffee, banana, pineapple, multiple vegetables, tubers, sugar cane,
melons, papaya, coconut, strawberries, flowers, and many more.","GotaBlanca is uniquely positioned in this space for 4 primary reasons:
1.	For starters, it is non-toxic
–	Although it destroys bacteria and fungi
–	It causes absolutely no harm to insects, animals, plants and humans
–	No PPE is required when using the product, other than basic respiratory protection which is required even when spraying water
2.	Secondly, microbes cannot develop resistance against it
–	Because the product destroys the microbes with a multi-point attack I described earlier
–	You can use the product as regularly as you like without the worry of resistance, or you can use it in your chemical cycle to extend the useful life of traditional chemicals.
3.	The third defining feature of GotaBlanca is that it is sustainable
–	The active ingredient is naturally sourced rather than chemically synthesized, meaning the product is certified organic in the EU, Japan and Costa Rica
–	Also, there is absolutely no toxic waste generated and no special precautions are required for waste disposal, as the product is harmless to humans and the environment
–	And even better, one of the ingredients is actually a waste product from palm oil production, so they are upcycling too!
–	Also when used as a shelf-life extender, it has the potential to reduce food waste and even alter transit methods of exporting fruit from by air to by sea, reducing CO2 emissions
4.	And finally, the applications for GotaBlanca are widespread
–	It is broad-spectrum in terms of the microbes it can destroy
–	We have trialed this on over 40 pathogens and are yet to find one it doesn’t kill, although some are tougher than others and require more applications
–	There are also 3 possible ways to apply the product: 1) as I just mentioned for post-harvest protection of produce to extend the shelf-life; 2) for pre-harvest preventative action to stop crops from becoming infected; and 3) for pre-harvest curative action to treat diseased crops","PRE-HARVEST MARKET
ClearLeaf sells liters of GotaBlanca ExWorks/Costa Rica with a healthy gross margin on each liter and recommends an average of 3 liters per hectare per application. ClearLeaf operates as a B2B company and has two types of clients: we sell our products directly to larger clients, such as multinationals and in parallel, we are developing distribution channels in countries with promising developments and ongoing activities. Considering just a modest portion of the markets and crops in which we know we will have a great deal of penetration (just a handful of specialty crops in the Americas) we have a potential SOM of just short of 1 billion dollars per year.
POST-HARVEST MARKET
GotaBlanca presents itself as an excellent alternative to reduce damage and deterioration of produce between the farmer and the final
consumer. ClearLeaf has repeatedly demonstrated that GotaBlanca shows excellent levels of control over microbes that attack post-harvest
produce, with no environmental or health impact. Given the current regulatory status in the USA and EU, ClearLeaf is confidently engaged in
the process of securing clearance for post-harvest use. This comes at a crucial point in time, given that farmers (including banana and pineapple
multinationals) are in the need to find new products to protect their harvest during overseas transit. Many agrochemicals currently being used
in this market are being phased out due to health concerns, through pressure of large clients and regulatory agencies.","GotaBlanca® combines two different innovative technological approaches that together change fungal and bacterial management strategies in a wide range of agricultural sectors for both pre and post-harvest applications.
Fox Rothschild, a top tier US law firm, submitted ClearLeaf’s WIPO PCT request through the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office on 3 April 2019 - GotaBlanca® (https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020201814) now has the status of PATENT PENDING. This patent covers “colloidal silver-based compositions and methods of use thereof for preventing and controlling plant diseases”. We are in the process of deploying national phase patents for GotaBlanca, with many of them already published. This allows for prosecution of any party that infringes on the patent.
On January 2020, also through Fox Rothschild, ClearLeaf submitted a patent request for the product line to be used in plant tissue culture (PlantDefense Kit - https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2021148914). The patent covers the methods and compositions to use our technology to prevent and reduce contamination in the plant tissue culture processes.","GotaBlanca® is currently sold in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and ClearLeaf expects to start commercializing its products in the rest of Central America no later than the end of Q3 2022. ClearLeaf recently secured an exclusive commercial agreement with Colono Agropecuario, the biggest agrochemical distributor in the Central American Region. Since going to market through this new distribution partner ten months ago, ClearLeaf has been able to sell over USD 130,000 worth of products. As a result of this ramp up in purchase orders, recently we moved into a bigger facility to increase our active ingredient production capabilities by a factor of 100x. We are currently negotiating distribution agreements with major players in the agrochemical industry in North and South America, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.","GotaBlanca® is one of the only non-toxic fungi-bactericides currently on the market, anywhere in the world. It is broad-spectrum, does not cause microbial resistance, enhances plant growth (rather than impeding it like most current products), does not affect on-farm (or off-farm) biological diversity, and can be applied at any time in the growing cycle (off-season, budding, growth, fruiting, and up to the moment of harvest). GotaBlanca® can also be used for the protection of post-harvest produce, to reduce damage and deterioration between the farm and the end consumer. ClearLeaf also has developed, and it is in the process of registering, GotaBlanca Home &amp; Garden, a ready to use fungicide and bactericide for home applications; and Plant Defense Kit, a set of tools to minimize microbial contamination in plant tissue culture processes,
which eliminates any microorganism upon contact, without affecting plant cells.",CLEARLEAF,10-Nov-17,9 - Low-rate production demonstrated.

Many people turn to plant foods because they do not want to eat meat (imitates) and the ingredient lists do not promise health and sustainability. Meat imitates have a target group and contribute to a good cause. But more than 768 million animal suffering and dying each year in factory farming in Germany alone as well as the huge amount of frustration in front of the plant protein shelves, show we need more and better alternatives to take the next steps we badly need to make.
Thus, we developed a natural, whole plant protein that actually tastes good and unique. For our Protino we use purely hempseeds and water (plus salt and spices/herbs for our spiced variations). Hempseeds provide a delicious taste, that is a new experience for most. Due to the aroma combining exceptionally well with popular foods like potatoes, wild rice, bell peppers, tomatoes or champignon mushrooms, the Protino can be included in most kitchens without complications. Also, the Protino is very versatile. It gets a golden-brown crust when fried in the pan. But it can also be used for sweet desert cremes, for example. Hemp also helps health-conscious eater providing a complete and well digestible protein and a lot of Omega 3. At the same time eating the Protino means contributing to the health of our fields, as hemp regenerates the soil, has a positive impact on biodiversity, binds a comparably high amount of Co2, can be cultivated with virtually no pesticides and be sourced locally.

By decreasing the dependence on manual labour, Viridius systems not only mitigate the impacts of worker’s scarcity but also allow farmers to grow economically viable crops in high-income countries, near the final consumers. The decentralization of fresh berries production translates to a less complex supply chain and an ultimate decrease in CO2 emissions. Moreover, soft robotics will allow agriculture to evolve into a more socially responsible industry, taking the burden off heavy labor under hard environmental conditions.","Current methods used in the harvest of raspberry for the fresh market harvest rely solely on manual labor, producing goods waste, often damaging the fruit, and that doesn’t feed real-time crop data to the value chain.

Many neurological and psychological conditions are poorly served by current drugs, leaving physicians, patients and their families desperately seeking alternative therapies, sometimes illegally. Cannabinoids and psychedelics are poised to offer breakthrough therapies for these debilitating conditions, but to realize the full potential of these molecules, issues with their production and undesirable properties must first be solved. Octarine is perfecting a biological approach to producing improved &amp; novel cannabinoid and psychedelic molecules with tailored modes-of-action. Our proprietary technology combines synthetic biology, yeast fermentation and enzymatic derivatization to develop IP protected drug candidates that are validated in pre-clinical screening.","The world is ready for a new treatment paradigm, there is now a wealth of robust clinical data showing that cannabinoids and psychedelics are significantly more effective than current first line treatments in a range of disease indications.
Octarine bio is at the forefront of technological innovation with strong IP position and validated technology platforms. The core of Octarine and the major source of competitive advantage is the founding team. Founders have a demonstrated track record successfully bringing bio-based production to market (e.g. yeast fermentation-based production of Resveratrol and Vanillin). Founders and research team have first author publications in world leading scientific journals e.g., Nature, Science, Natural Product Reports, Metabolic engineering. Octarine will continue to pursue two flagship programs in parallel focusing cannabinoids and psychedelics capturing the opportunities from well-established cannabinoids market and of the ongoing psychedelic renaissance. Octarine will be a very attractive company and we see great potential for multiple exit strategies—either through acquisition, further VC investment, or an eventual IPO.","We aim for a business-to-business model where we partner with an established industrial players in each segment. Octarine would generate, screen and validate improved cannabinoid and psilocybin molecules to identify a lead molecules while the partner would take the molecule through approval process and all the way to the market. The revenue model would be based on upfront payment (exclusivity option fee), R&amp;D millstone payments to Octarine upon successful milestone achievements, and royalty payments to Octarine upon successful sales of products by the partner.
Having multiple potential products in the portfolio with few shared risk factors creates diversification and allows us to abandon certain projects should they prove to be unviable. In the short-term this means having focus on novel cannabinoids (CBD-glycosides) and tryptamine psychedelics (psilocybin derivatives).","Three international patent application families (2 of them at national phase, one at PCT stage) - Two of them owns by Octarine and one is licensed from DTU (Technical University of Denmark)",Yeast fermentation is known technology to produce high value molecules in multiple industries.,"There are two key problems:
1) Limited access to a reliable and cost-effective supply: Today, these molecules are predominantly supplied via extraction from their native host, an expensive and resource intensive process due to the fact that these molecules are typically produced in minute quantities in their native host. Additionally, their complex molecular structure and stereospecificity makes alternative methods of production like chemical synthesis prohibitively difficult and expensive.
2) Undesirable Properties of molecules: While these molecules have potent therapeutic effect, issues such as poor pharmacokinetics, undesirable side-effects, and limited formulation options are currently hindering their application in the market. Cannabinoids for example are completely insoluble in water, have an extremely low oral bioavailability (less than 5%), and rapidly degrade even under ambient conditions.

Using our technology, material producers can reduce the volume of agricultural waste that is disposed, while at the same time contributing to the need for sustainable materials.","Our business model is about technology transfer B2B. We will license our proprietary technology (which includes patents, trade secrets, know how, etc.) about the process that we have developed.
This model allows us for a powerful growth as we will be able to supply more than one industry at the same time.
Our international scale up model will also allow for an expansion not only within the EU but also in other continents. That is the reason to extend our patent application, that is currently in the PCT national phase, to countries of 3 continents plus Argentina and Uruguay.
Our busines model brings advantages to the whole food production process and offering solutions to the side stream generators/managers and to the industries that are looking for sustainable solutions with a competitive advantage.
The triple impact of our business model also makes a difference. It is not only about the economical value but about social conscience and environmental impact.
The increase in world population and therefore in food need, will generate more vegetal waste. This trend will supply our technology and business model with an increase amount of raw material and at the same time provide a solution for a worldwide problem that is currently being generated.","The technology can be used with more than 40 different vegetal waste and is protected by a patent application. In August 2020, we filed the International Patent Application (PCT), protecting our technology in 57 countries worldwide, and since February 2022 it is at PCT national phase.","Our technology has not yet been implemented on an industrial scale. Currently, we are in a prototyping state for supermarket trays and disposable cutlery. We continue working to scale from the lab to industrial manufacturing: we have a demonstrative plant in Zaragoza (Spain) and we also collaborate with a third party for prototype moulding of our final goods.
In this sense, the potential of the technology is very strong. Currently we have already successfully tried more than 40 different type of vegetal waste. This allows us to create 4 different type of materials: Feltwood pack (an alternative to thermo formed plastics), Feltwood hard (an alternative to rigid plastics), Feltwood anti-impact (an alternative to expanded polystyrene) and Feltwood insulation (an alternative to synthetic insulating polymers and other insulating materials).
Due to financing constrains we have decided to focus our current efforts on the first 2 materials.
The current profile, at this stage of our development, of our customers are those companies that produce vegetal side streams (both in agriculture or industry) after processing their food products and that also use food packaging. For such customers we provide two benefits: on one hand we give value to the side streams and make them avoid expenses to dispose them. On the other hand our technology will supply them with sustainable packaging.
As you  may understand our customer target will evolve from the current ones to users of disposable packaging that want to stress recyclability, sustainability and lower their carbon footprint.
Once the technology will be consolidated with one of the materials we will continue with marketing of the others not only at European level but internationally.","Food and agricultural industry generates large amounts of waste, disposal of which is expensive to producers and waste managers. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that globally, in the food sector, around 45% of fruits and vegetables are wasted.
Effective repurposing of agricultural waste into useful products is underutilized due to lack of sustainable and cost-effective technologies for scale-up, and compost production is not viable for waste managers due to the hight waste volumes. As a result, enormous volumes of agricultural waste are being disposed.
On the other hand, plastic pollution is one of the most relevant challenges that we are facing today that causes severe health and environmental problems. If nothing is done, the cost of plastic pollution, only in Europe, will be €22 billion by 2030.
WWF estimates that, on average, people could be ingesting approximately 5 grams of microplastics, equivalent of a credit card weekly.
A European directive banning a range of single-use plastics came into law in July 2021, forcing the plastic producers to use sustainable alternatives. This requires high volumes of alternative materials that are currently simply not available.",FELTWOOD,,5 - Capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment.,1.000.000 to 2.500.000,"English, Español",,"TRL 5 – technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies)

At its core SyMBioTech focusses on production of Omega-3 lipids from microalgae using an innovative new platform for more cost-competitive production of these and other, high-value products.  Compared to current technology, SyMBioTechs’s patent-pending Photodynamic Biofilm Reactor (PdBR) provides for a two-fold increase in biomass productivity, substantially reduced processing costs and stable year-round supply of high-quality, high-purity Omega-3s for the food and nutraceutical sectors.  Cultivating photosynthetic microalgae species, SyMBioTech’s process will also provide for CO2-sequestration from a variety of industrial sources with the added potential for renewable energy generation through anaerobic digestion of defatted biomass. Following a mobile, modular design, SyMBioTech is positioning its PdBR technology for full integration into the emerging circular economy, providing a readily scalable, low-impact platform for cost-competitive production of high-value Omega-3 lipids in Ireland.","The  multi-faceted potential of SyMBioTech is reflected in steady growth of the Global Microalgae Biomass Market which is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 4.3% to reach around €4 Billion by 2027.  Developing outputs from the Enterprise Ireland funded project SyMO3, we are currently in an intensive development phase that will bring our prototype PdBR technology to TRL 7 by the end of May 2022.  In tandem with this, we are developing a structured business model to meaningfully address omega-3 market opportunities and develop partnerships with potential customers to refine our oil extracts.

With revolutionary breeding and bio-conversion technologies, we maximise the extraction of high-value protein, oil and fertiliser products for the aquaculture, animal feed and plant nutrition industries.

This compares to avg. 50kg C02 eq per 100g of beef. We use no chemicals, no antibiotics and no additives to create our product. We allow nature to take it's course.
Hexafly can create a complete circular economy allowing producers, retailers and consumers to participate in the process by providing 'feed' for our insect farm (brewers grains, fruit &amp; veg waste etc) and in turn they can use our products to feed animals and plants and continue this cycle. We are at the forefront of multiple billion euro industries during a time when problems around oil and food security are becoming increasingly dangerous.","Hexafly operate a Hybrid model.

B2B involves selling our products to distributors, wholesalers and online. The split is  currently 80% B2B and 20% B2C","We have IP relating to a number of our products. This IP focuses on animal and human health and immunity, and natural pest control for crops.","Yes, there are other companies, predominantly based in Europe that farm insects. No company has taken a significant share of the market to date and it is currently a race to scale as there are a number of large feed players in the market interested in gaining access to large quantities of insect products. Supply cannot keep up with demand at present. The global feed market is valued at  €450 billion.","To keep up with population growth, global food production will have to increase by at least 70% by 2050. Conventional sources of protein from animals or plants are unsustainable. Increased demand for protein, increases demand for multiple natural resources, land, water, oil (fertiliser) and more. As the number of animals needed to fill our protein requirements increases,  a great strain is put on animal feed sources and agricultural land, driving up unsustainable land usage across the globe. The increase in feed requirements results in deforestation, depletion of fresh water resources and reduced air, land and water quality as farmers increase their use of chemical fertilisers in an attempt to keep up with demand from humans and animals.
Part of the current solution is encouraging people to eat more fish. As a result, we are becoming more reliant on aquaculture farms that supply nearly 50% of fish consumed by humans now. Aquaculture feed is 30-50% fishmeal, a feed produced from wild-caught fish (yes, that means feeding wild-caught fish to farmed fish).

We are creating systems that increase the volume of seaweed through cultivation to meet growing market demands whilst improving ocean quality and turning fishers into ocean farmers. Our system of modulated floating farms removes many of the barriers to market entry such as: permits, licensing, environmental studies, science of native and appropriate seeding and considerable infrastructure costs. We lease pre-seeded units to fishers, offering a network of designated offshore sites for mooring.  This highly skilled cohort of fishers has appropriate skills and equipment and need additional income streams without damaging the delicate marine eco-system.  When the stock is fully grown our floating farms links with our modulated, innovative processing systems located close to shore around the coastline capturing previously lost micronutrients, moisture and minerals, we increase the value of seaweed.  Working in partnership with local individuals and communities through owner-operated systems we create more output from less biomass.  Each unit produces liquid and solid seaweed outputs creating a supply chain in volume through multiple units to meet growing industrial demands. Collecting daily, similar to the diary sector, we homogenize, and quality validate increasing the value of the outputs at every stage.

1)	Modulated, pre-seeded, floating seaweed farms to increase the volume of biomass
2)	Near shore processing systems that will increase the value of seaweed.
Firstly that of the towable floating farm which enables the fishing community to engage in ocean farming. A demonstration modulated unit is being trialed at a scale of 50% in Blacksod Bay, the unit which is known across the EU as a 'survival site'.  This will test a number practical aspects of the unit including the materials, structure, required engine capacity, design, towability, the amount of detris sinking to deep ocean, the yield to seed ratio and the physical handling and skills.
The second element of the proposal has been tested at lab scale, there is much evidence supporting and validating the value of the compounds within a range of seaweeds.  Our system has yet to be demonstrated as a complete flow in-situ.  We have technical drawings, costings, engineers, science labs, harvester and even a licensed site ready.  We are currently pitching for early stage funding to build the first prototype.","As market demands for seaweed increase and the pressure placed on seaweed harvesters and the ocean is clearly unsustainable.  Over 90% of Irish seaweed sales coming from wild harvested stocks.  Applications in many sectors, not lease the food and feed demands increase as populations rise and extreme conditions makes tradition food supply chains more challenging at a time when we need to increase food production by 70%.  Global water shortages, land restrictions, focuses global attention towards ocean farming.  We cannot rely on wild stock as fish and oceanic vegetation is under threat.
Redrose aims to provide solutions by creating a sustainable seaweed supply chain. Global seaweed sales forecast exceeds $9b by 2024. 77% of which is for human consumption this is almost $7b pa as demands for plant-based foods increase.  Our systems address market access problems by supporting fishers to become ocean farmers.  We address concerns around inequality in the supply chain value system.

Our platform is initially based on the glycolipid technology platform with the yeast Starmerella bombicola, that has been developed and scaled up over the last 15 years by Ghent University (InBio research group) and the Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant (BBEPP).
AmphiStar has the mission to develop, scale up and demonstrate biosurfactant technology at industrially relevant level. To achieve this, we bring together the required technologies, know-how and IP into a platform technology for biosurfactants with freedom-to-operate. As such, AmphiStar aids in the transition from a fossil-based to a more environment friendly, bio-based industry. Our technology is fully in line with the vision of a circular economy, allowing a high standard of living while using chemicals and materials produced by sustainable production systems out of renewable (biomass) raw materials.
We derisk the early development stage for biosurfactant production, guide and support technology transfer to industrial production sites and collaborate intensely for further development and improvement of the licensed technology.","Classical biosurfactants already on the market are complex mixtures of biosurfactant variants, which limits their use to the highly competitive low margin detergent business. AmphiStar’s portfolio of over 25 different specific biosurfactant variants offers diversity, uniformity and high purity which enables further derivatisations and entry to higher value applications. This gives AmphiStar truly a unique position in the competitive landscape, next to the fact that all competitors are potential customers.
AmphiStar’s microbial biosurfactants perfectly fit into a circular and sustainable economy:
–	Biobased: made from local, sustainable, renewable feedstocks or waste streams
–	Bioprocess: fermentation is a clean production technology safe for people and the environment
–	Biodegradable: environmentally friendly, palm oil-free, sulfate-free, mild, non-toxic and non-irritant","AmphiStar follows a flexible hybrid business model that includes both licensing out the technology to established surfactant manufacturers or users, as well as contract technology and application development for its licensees and third parties. AmphiStar valorises its developed technology mainly in two ways:
–	Licensing out its technology packages in return for royalties
–	Performing contract R&amp;D projects for its licensees and third parties
In many cases, the valorisation strategy through licensing and contract research goes hand in hand with the same partner, in the form of a Licence Agreement coupled to a Joint Development Agreement to further develop and improve the licensed technology.
The preferred valorisation model is to license out the developed technology packages to established surfactant producers with good market access and ideally possessing suitable production facilities for biosurfactants.

The announcement of Unilever two years ago to completely eliminate fossil fuels in all of their cleaning products by 2030 has drastically changed the mindset of all suppliers and ingredient producers. Major partnerships have been announced with the most prominent example Evonik, currently building a 10 000 ton/year production plant for rhamnolipids in Slovakia. Large surfactant producers and chemical companies are desperately looking for solutions and actively contacting AmphiStar to support them.","We all use surfactants every day, from shampoo and toothpaste to food, paints, ink and pharmaceuticals! It is no surprise then that the surfactant market is over 20 million tonnes or 40 billion euros per year. The consumer is pushing for greener products, but less than 0.5% of surfactants are currently produced biologically. The reason for this huge market failure is that conventional surfactant producers are chemical companies, that lack biotechnology skills and production facilities. Because of this, biotechnological production processes are not as mature as the chemical ones and the price of biosurfactants is still too high.
AmphiStar tackles these issues by providing unique high performance biosurfactant production technology and expertise to surfactant producers.",AMPHISTAR,30-Jul-21,8 - Pilot line capability demonstrated.

We want to empower individuals and businesses to reduce their fossil fuel reliance and join the cleantech revolution from the comfort of their kitchens.
MyGug is a “start-up” four years in the making, having de-risked the R&amp;D in that time through design, manufacturing and testing.
We believe this is optimal timing for our full launch with energy, food waste, carbon and fertiliser prices at all-time highs, resulting in lower payback periods and additional revenue streams.","MyGug is a winner from a number of angles:
1. Reducing GHG emissions
2. Solving the growing problem of excess waste worldwide
3. Providing energy security and enabling micro circular economies
4. Offering a positive NPV/financial return to the customer","We currently intend on selling units outright to the customer. In time we are going to consider a leasing revenue model, introducing Biogas-As-A-Service (BAAS).
Our addressable market is huge and our obtainable market is mapped out with a number of initial, high probability of execution, target markets for MyGug:
-Sustainability-focused consumers, hotels, restaurants and cafes
-Multi-national corporates with canteen facilities and net-zero targets
-Garden centres and nurseries
-2nd and 3rd level educational bodies
We have nurtured a substantial lead-list to pitch to post funding round.","Yes, Patent confirmed in the EU, Canada, Norway and the UK. Confirmation awaited from the US and Switzerland. More details available if needed.","Yes, there are thousands of large and medium scale AD plants in Western Europe but only a very small numbers of micro scale AD plants. Globally there are known to be over 6 millions small scale biogas plants operating, especially in Africa and Asia.
The USP of MyGug is that our micro AD can be used in cold climates as well as hot climates. We believe we are the first company to market with this development.","1. Waste: Almost all food waste can be diverted to MyGug for gasification minimizing bills and offering easy waste management.
2. GHG Emissions: Carbon footprint reduction due to replacement of fossil fuel natural gas and elimination of transport of waste and associated landfill GHG emissions.
3. Operating Costs: Energy security and reduced exposure to market/bill shocks with waste removal costs also reduced.

We break down the chemical structure of the oil obtained from the shell of cashew-nuts, called cardanol.
From cardanol we propose novel low-tox petrochemicals substitutes with a carbon-neutral impact (cradle to gate).","In a very simple process, we break down cardanol's molecular structure (Cashew-Shell-Oil) into its aromatic and aliphatic fractions and (from there) select high-value 100% bio monomeric bases, used as such or further modified into different  highly functional bio-products.","Sales of bio-chemicals per kg unit, for both low and high specialistic applications.
The company is already active in most of the identified sectors, with own contacts, but primarily in Europe. We are establishing key partnerships worldwide to help us boosting the related demand in regions with limited reach for us (Asia, Oceania, Europe), as well as for applications, requiring different expertise than ours (pharma and cosmetics for example).
Overall, we are working in market segments such as constructions, animal husbandry, pharma, surfactants and detergents, cosmetics and fragrances and industrial manufacturing.","The technology has been patented in 2014 by the University of St Andrews, with inventor our CTO, David Cole-Hamilton. The patent has been licensed with worldwide exclusivity to the company ; it also encloses a title-transfer clause after a certain amount of paid royalties.
Currently we keep producing new knowhow , in relation to the scaleup of the technology.","We have defined important applications and clients, based on the proposed products, such as:
1.  linear 3-non-enyl-phenol (3NP) ethoxylates in surfactants and detergents
2.  the 3-vinylphenol (3VP) in adhesives and polymerisation
3. the 3-propylphenol (3PP) as a pheromone attracting tse-tse flies in Africa and many others.
These are all applications that have already been backed up by peer-reviewed scientific  articles and/or are based on the very similar structure of the proposed products to the standard counter-parts currently in use by the industry. Overall, we are waiting to obtain results ourselves, based on the started projects.","Climate change, depletion of fossil fuels and the need to feed an increasing world population require a change in chemical manufacture from fossil fuel based to biobased without reducing the land area available for food.  One resource that meets these requirements is an aromatic-aliphatic molecule, derivative of the cashew-nut-shells, called cardanol, underexploited and with a worldwide availability of 700,000tn pa.
Today, in the industry cardanol is functionalised and polymerised to get to polymers applicable in coatings, adhesives, foams and surfactants. However, we have demonstrated that cardanol (as a base) can be improved for its performance in the above mentioned fields and made applicable to many others (pharma, fragrances, cosmetics,  insect-attractants and more) by taking a different approach.
In a very simple process, we break down its molecular structure into its aromatic and aliphatic parts and (from there) select high-value 100% bio monomeric bases, used as such or further modified into different  highly functional bio-products.
We propose to produce two versatile platform chemicals, 3-non-8-enylphenol (3-NP) and 3-vinylphenol (3-VP) directly from cardanol.","CSBR, CASHEW SHELL BIOREFINERY",,4 - Capability to produce the technology in a laboratory environment,501.000 to 1.000.000,"Italiano, English, German, Français",145_P,TRL 5 – technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies),"Limburg, Netherlands","Fragrances, Cosmetics, Personal Care, Plastics, Materials, Textiles, Platform and specialty Chemicals, Waste valorisation",Pierluigi,Ferri,General Manager,https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierluigi-ferri-9266934a/,,,,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/upa6Rew9fpY?feature=oembed

d) EU ETS Carbon Tariff savings (currently $40/ton – projected to $100+ /ton) with our heavy industry CO2 emitter who partners with us
Highest profit margins rely on carotenoids &amp; omega-3’s extraction during our protein production for food &amp; nonfood apps","Solmeyea’s patented vertical farming microalgae cultivation in data-driven tubular photobioreactor is based on a natural biological process called mixotrophy showing quadrupled production rates compared to classic autotrophic cultivation modes. Our process is using a glucose-substitute in addition of CO2 as inputs, avoiding the important environmental burdens caused by glucose (deforestation, biodiversity loss). Our rich in nutrients natural biomass is harvested and dried following a continuous process allowing the best growing rates and high nutrient recovery with 95% water recirculation. Therefore, the system has minimal water and land footprint compared to soy and reduced carbon footprint. However, our process doesn’t stop here. It includes fractionation and extraction of the limited-uses whole biomass in multi-application functional extracts including:
Full EAAs profile protein isolates and hydrolysates
EPA-DHA rich oil
Natural pigment rich oils
Efficient implementation of these extracts in food formulations can only be done in close collaboration between Solmeyea and the exploitation partners food manufacturers under the supervision of the biggest microalgae research center of Europe, AlgaePARC. Solmeyea will be using an extraction and fractionation downstream process already proven by the research teams of AlgaePARC. This full cascade approach will be enhanced and adjusted depending on end-producer feedbacks until full validation of Solmeyea’s final food ingredients.","food sector
