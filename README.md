* Utilized Python and Selenium for web scraping on BioEconomy Ventures platform.
* Extracted company names, social media accounts, descriptions, establishment dates, MRL, requested investments, language, TRL, location, category, and first three LinkedIn profiles.

### Description:

Using Selenium, I automated the process of navigating through each investor and start-up profile page, ensuring that no valuable data was missed. The following data points were collected for each profile:

* Company Name: Extracted the name of the investor or start-up.
* Social Media Accounts: Gathered the Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn profiles associated with the company.
* Description: Captured the entire description of the company, providing insights into its activities and objectives.
* Date of Establishment: Recorded the date when the company was established.
* MRL (Market Readiness Level): Collected the MRL of the company, indicating its stage of development and market readiness.
* Requested Investment: Obtained information on the investment amount or funding sought by the start-up.
* Language: Recorded the primary language used by the company.
* TRL (Technology Readiness Level): Gathered the TRL of the start-up, reflecting the maturity level of its technology.
* Location: Extracted the geographical location of the company.
* Category: Categorized the company into a specific industry or sector.
* First Three LinkedIn Profiles: Collected the LinkedIn profiles of the first three members listed on the company's page.

To organize the data, two separate CSV files were created. One file contained the information for the investors, and the other file contained the data for the start-ups. This division allowed for easy access and analysis of the data.

### Conclusion:
Overall, this web scraping project successfully extracted comprehensive data from the BioEconomy Ventures platform website, enabling further analysis and exploration of the investor and start-up profiles.
